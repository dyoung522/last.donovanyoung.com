Peter is having his first real physical therapy this morning.  7:30 am!!!!!!  Problem is, my mattress topper is being delivered at 9:00.  I don't care if they have him flying, I'm staying here for that. It came right on schedule.  Ah, rest!

<IMG:01:L>Things are a little different here and some customs are pretty hard to get used to.  In the elevator, coming to the 12th floor, I can't imagine what would happen if it got stuck.  They cram as many people in there as humanly possible.  When the doors open it is like a clown car at the circus and when you're in it you just pray it makes it all the way up.  They will even crowd you to get a wheelchair added in when you didn't think even another skinny body could make it.  Oddly enough (hallelujah) no one smells.  Even in this heat.  

Another loathsome habit is spitting.  Yuch!  It is considered extremely rude to blow your nose in public, but let it drain into your throat and it's party time.  The hacking and spewing!  It's disgusting.  

Tomorrow is the fourth and all the Americans at the hospital are going to Hanks Bar and Grill.  He's an American guy we met at the party at the St. Regis on Sunday.  There will be a grill with American hot dogs and hamburgers and he's trying to get some fireworks.  Don't know why he's having a problem with that.  Jeez, they invented them here and most assuredly make the worlds supply.  

July 4
<IMG:01:R>Made it on time this morning. The physical therapy room is state of the art.  First they put him on a table and stretch his right side for a while.  Then it's off to the machines.  Peter seems to enjoy it.  

<IMG:02:L>We made it to the fourth of July party at Hanks Bar and Grill.  Turns out Hank is from Chicago.  Bridgeport to be exact and boy, it shows.  Big belly, direct gruff manner and old T shirt.  He's a super guy though.  Grilled us hamburgers and had a great display of fireworks.  It was fun.  There were 12 of us.  Three in wheelchairs.  Peter sat next to Christian who had the same kind of stroke he had.  Neither could talk and it was sad because Peter kind of avoided engaging.  He enjoyed the night as a whole though.  Christian's stroke was a year and a half ago and he is walking.  Not talking, though, which is a little scary.  He and Adrienne had only been married a year when that happened.  Can you imagine?She's a pretty amazing person.  Very full of energy.    

July 5
Walked the ten minutes to the hospital. It's so hot here.  I brought my fancy parasol that I paid a fortune for from Amazon before we left.  I use it all the time and don't stick out because almost everyone uses them here.   And what a surprise: they're all just like mine. How did that happen?  

They're replacing the carpet in the hallways today.  About time, it was pretty disgusting.  Everything's a mess and they're not allowing any of the patients out of their rooms. The floor is wet and a little slippery. "too danger".  Peter is amusing himself with the newspaper and taking a long time to eat.  That's ok.  Hope they finish soon so he can go back to physical therapy.

We've decided to take him out most nights to get him away from here a little bit each day.  That's been working ok. We take Wong along whenever we can and let him order something we might not.  Last night he ordered a chicken dish.  The chicken was tender and delicious but THE HEAD was on the plate.  Eeewww.  Wong ate it with relish!  
Double eeeww.

July 6
No physical therapy again.  Still can't get out of the room although they're almost finished with the floor.  It's not new carpet, but a sort of vinyl. Peter took a great interest in the stacked up rolls and inspected the material closely.  Later, we snuck out anyway for dinner and went to a pretty fancy place.  Wong joined us again but no disgusting head of a chicken this time, thank god. <IMG:01:L>We also brought along another young girl who is here with her mother from Russia.  Valerie.  She's 18 and was in a bad car accident.  This is her second trip to this hospital and she feels like it has been helping a lot.  She's so sweet.  She has difficulty talking but speaks English very well. Her mother, Lena, though speaks not a word.  Still, they're fun to have around.  

<IMG:02:R>I'm hoping Wong can join us most nights. He doesn't make very much and he is so wonderful.  Attentive, compassionate, knowledgeable and encouraging.  He will do whatever we ask. He has Peter standing to strengthen his leg a few times every day.   He had been giving Peter a soaking treatment with herb water every afternoon but I saw on the bill that they charge for it because normally the nurses do it.  I pointed that out to them and from then on they've sent the nurses in.  Sh........t.  Screwed that one up.  Wong did it with so much more feeling.  It's routine for the nurses.

I know its not allowed and considered gosh to offer money so to get around that I told  Wong that I would like to pay him for doing that treatment but he refused any money anyway.  I'm hoping that by taking him out to dinner with us he saves a bit. He gladly accepts that though can't know if he thinks it's part of his job to come with us and that we're keeping him from his family or something.  Have to find that out.    

July 7
Haven't seen Adrienne and Christian for a few days. Pam said they both have some sort of bug.  They're both coughing a lot with sore throats.  Hope it doesn't spread.  No one else seems affected yet, though.  

Michelle was out all day getting her massage.  She won it as a door prize at the St. Regis 4th of July party.  I won something too.  Haven't mentioned it yet cause its so ridiculous.  I won a dental exam.  Great, I'm rushing right out.  They had two of those and the first one went to a kid.  I was laughing at the notion of a kid winning a dental exam when they called my number.  Had to go up to the front to accept it.  I wasn't laughing anymore.  Jeez, how embarrassing.  I gave the certificate to Ruth who could either use it herself or give it to someone who could.  I've seen the teeth around here.  No thanks.  

For Peter, no therapy yet again.  They're really slow getting this work done.  They are coming in for his other treatments so it's not a total waste.  It's Saturday so only one acupuncture treatment but the soaks and Wong's massages continue.  He doesn't want to go out for dinner so we leave to pick some up. 

There are so many restaurants around here including a KFC, a Subway and a Pizza Hut.  Pam and I went to KFC cause Trevor wanted a chicken sandwich.  I though, ugh, fried chicken, but to my surprise they had all kinds of things.  I got four dinners with grilled chicken, rice and a delicious sauce.  It was cheaper than the stupid sandwich.  20 yuan which is a little more than $3.00.  Cheap, cheap, cheap.   We all finished every bite.  

July 8
<IMG:01:R>Skyped with David and Arthur this morning.  Peter was in the bathroom when they came on and Wong had him walking to the computer. I had the camera turned so they could see that.  Peter loved talking to them and laughed at all Arthur's antics. Sticking his finger in David's ear and getting his mouth close to the camera to inspect his lip and stuff.  It really perked him up.  In a little over a week I think the biggest change I've seen in Peter so far is that his gaze seems more focused.  I think that's a big deal.  David and Arthur noticed it too and wrote me later to say they were encouraged.  I made them jealous by showing him surrounded by nurses.

It's Sunday, no physical therapy anyway and only one acupuncture treatment.  Lazy day. Went out to dinner with Wong, Peter, Eugene and his mom.  Michelle went shopping with Pam and the rest and would not be joining us.  Eugene wanted to go to this Korean buffet where you cook your own food on a grill at your table.  What a disaster.  First, the selection of food was enormous but I didn't know what anything was.  It was all raw.  You had to take a big plate of raw bacon. This served as the grease to cook your food.  You put it on the grill and as it cooks down, you can cook your food.  The only thing I recognized was chicken so I took a lot of that.  The rest was unidentifiable fish parts and god knows what else.  The grill began to smoke immensely as I put the bacon on there.  It was horrific.  Not only that, but they expected you to put your cooked food on the same plate the raw stuff came from.  Who does that??  I didn't care what they thought, I got clean plates.  Its a wonder there are any Koreans still alive.  The dumplings were good though.  

July 9
Skyped with Arthur and David this morning again.  They called Donovan who joined us there. It was really cool. All of them seeing Peter and each other at the same time from literally all corners of the globe.  They tried to get Adam and Jamison too but neither answered their phones.   It was 10:00 Sunday night for them and they weren't expecting a phone call so not surprising.  We will plan it better for the next one.  

Donovan had Erica with him and Reed was there too so everyone got to see Peter get his acupuncture treatment.  I think they were a little surprised at the number of needles all over his body.  The doctors didn't mind at all that they were watching.  Arthur of course cracked them up with his shenanigans. Stabbing David with a pen as they were inserting the needles.  They thought it was pretty funny.  Peter was the only one not laughing, poor guy.

Went to the bakery with Pam for the daily cappuccino and while we were sitting at a little table one of the clerks came over and said in very broken English "my English poor but umm umm you teach?"  We finally worked it out that he would like us to come by at his quitting time to talk for a while so his English gets better.  Maybe he will teach us some mandarin too.  Should be fun.  

July 10
Skyped this morning with Arthur, David, and Donovan again. This time we were able to get Jamison and Adam on there too.  They all watched Peter get a few of his treatments but Peter wasn't real happy about it because he couldn't respond and then, to add insult to injury, while he was laying on his side (luckily facing away from the camera) Wong pulled his pants halfway down to let the doctors look at a red spot on his lower back.  Peter said at once "I want to say goodbye" so we ended the session.  We will do it again when it is morning for them and evening for us.  That's better for Peter.  

<IMG:01:R>Rained all day and I have to walk rain or shine.  It wasn't too bad since it cooled it off a little.  The traffic here is ridiculous. It's every man for himself like a big game of chicken. Pedestrians included.  Every car thinks it has the right of way and if they have the position, they figure they do.  They're honking at the others to let them through all the time. The cacophony is deafening at the intersections. Thousands of bikes, scooters and cars vying for position.   Add pedestrians into that mix and you have true chaos. If they don't have a lane, they make one.   It's a wonder I haven't seen any bad accidents yet.  Plenty of close ones though.  I'm  crossing the street when a crowd does and figuring out my timing between whooshing cars. It's like a not-so-delicate dance where a misstep can be disastrous.

We are taking Peter out to dinner every night now.  Wong goes with us and leads the way across the street with Peter in the wheelchair.  He's used to this so we just stay on his heels.  We figure they won't hit a bunch of us at once.  

July 11
Still raining.  Jeez.  The breakfasts are a little less mysterious. I've sort of figured out what good. There are a few other things that I don't know what the h....l it is and haven't felt adventurous enough yet to try.  Black eggs and dark noodle looking things.  Peter gets his breakfast at the hospital along with Michelle and they order what they want from a menu.  Lucky ducks.    

Michelle is leaving tomorrow morning to go back to the states for two weeks.  Wong is staying with Peter for that time. She's staying in Beijing overnight cause she has an early flight.   She's  anxious and busy getting ready, making sure she has her hotel in Beijing  written in Chinese characters to show the cab driver when she gets there.  Pam and Adrienne will surely miss her because she really livens up any room. 

During the soaking of his arm and leg this afternoon he said a big sentence. " hey Toni, how about watching some television?". I was floored.  I hope this is the beginning of more and more.  

Ruth arranged for me to do some sightseeing tomorrow with a student assistant of hers.  This girl speaks pretty good English and is a native of Tianjin.  Should be interesting.  

July 12
<IMG:01:R>I certainly saw a different part of Tianjin today.  There is even a tourist area where they have horse drawn carriages.  She also took me to another part that is called "cultural street" but in reality is nothing more than a tourist trap with fake old buildings and souvenir shops.  <IMG:02:L>Some funny signs though.  There were a few interesting galleries in the mix but I won't be going back there.  Another part I saw is called The Italian District filled with German restaurants?????  The architecture is pretty diverse with European style buildings mixed with communist style drab apartment blocks.  <IMG:03:R>I learned that Pu Li, the last emperor and the subject of that film fled to Tianjin when he was dethroned.  She showed me his house.  That was cool.

Well, Michelle is gone.  Hope she makes out okay on her own. 

July 13
I learned today that Peter will be going into the hyperbaric oxygen chamber for at least 10 sessions.  I wish we could have done that immediately after the stroke but it wasn't available in the US where we were.  They tell me it will help his speech. We'll see. He starts tomorrow.

The nurses told me he moved his arm but I don't believe them just yet.  Peter says no too.  I think the tone in his arm may have contracted making it look like it moved.  I don't want to be disappointed so until there is more evidence I'll presume it is that.  

I've also ordered extra physical therapy for him so I hope that starts soon.  Can't wait till he can walk.  Christian, Adrianne's husband, can walk with a cane.  It is very laborious but it makes going in and out of restaurants so much easier.  He's not talking much, though.  Just gibberish.  I'm glad Peter doesn't do that.  

July 14
<IMG:01:R>I walked in this morning and got "hello Toni". Wow.  He goes into the hyperbaric chamber this afternoon. Went at 3:00 and it was quite an experience. He went into a futuristic looking contraption that looked like the hull of a plane. I don't know how many people it held but it was a lot. All sitting along the edge facing the center like in a military plane.  They gave him a bottle of water and told him to sip it if his ears became uncomfortable.  He was in there for over an hour.  Hope it helps to restore some cognitive functions.  He will have a total of 10 sessions but next time we'll go a little earlier to avoid that crowd.  It's worse than the elevator. 

Speaking of that, there was a new twist today.  It was crowded as usual, but this time they added a gurney with a person with tubes and things hanging out.  Right there. In the passenger elevator. Got it in too.  Incredible. 

They sure do things differently here.  The toilet paper they supply for the bathroom looks like a white streamer.  As narrow and as rough.  There's a big store close by so I buy softer, wider tissue there.  That store is like a big Target but I understand it's a French chain.  Carrefour.  They have most of what we need.  We lugged big bottles of body soap, shampoo and other toiletries from home but there was no need for that.  Dumb.  What did I think?  They don't wash here?

I bought an angry birds pencil holder for Max there and we're using it in the room so we don't have to look for a pen constantly anymore.  Wong had never seen that so I showed him the angry birds app on my iPad.  He's hooked now.  Oh, oh.  

It's Saturday so only morning treatments. Thought we'd go to the zoo but it's pretty hot.  Well see.  

Turned out to be too hot to be outside for too long so stayed in.  Besides, I had a horrible headache.  I told one of the nurses thinking I would get a pill but a doctor came in and the next thing I knew I had a bunch of needles in my neck, head and arms.
  Ouch.  I didn't know they hurt like that.  Jeez, Peter gets this twice every day.  It better be worth it for him!  Lo and behold, though, no more headache!!!!!!!

July 15
It's Sunday so the whole afternoon is free.  Yippee.  It has cooled off a little so we want to go out.  The strap on Wong's sandal keeps falling off and he picks up that little piece of hardware and pounds it back in. They're the only ones I've seen him wear.  He doesn't get paid a lot so shoes must be a luxury so I though we'd go out and get him some new ones.  Everyone wanted to go shopping anyway.  There is a street here that is miles long with nothing but high rise malls and shops. Actually, I think the whole city is lined with shops but this is really over the top.  We got there by cab.  They don't always want to take a wheelchair and many pass us by but eventually one stops.  We went into the men's shoe department of a department store and I pointed to a row of men's sandals.  He pointed to his own (fixed for the moment) and gave me a look like "are you crazy, I have these". He ended up choosing a pair of loafers. Go figure.

We ate at a nearby restaurant and when we were back outside Peter very plainly said"I want to go home" meaning the hospital.  He'd had enough of shopping I guess.  Later, we skyped with Adam Alice and the boys.  It was supposed to be everyone but the rest of the lazybones didn't feel like getting up, I guess.  Peter talked more than I've heard yet.  He said "we went shopping" "I had a good dinner" and a lot of other phrases.  He also got a kick out of Nicky's antics and Bryce being super cute.  The sound quality of Skype is pretty bad so they didn't hear a lot of it.  Next time Adam and I thought a concurrent phone conversation might help.
